# Movie-Genre-Prediction
### Description:  

The **Movie Genre Prediction** project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify movies into specific genres based on their plot summaries and other features. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project involves preprocessing the text data, extracting relevant features, and applying classification algorithms to predict genres accurately.  

The dataset typically contains movie information, including plot summaries, genres, and additional metadata. Plot summaries are analyzed and transformed into numerical representations using NLP techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization. These representations are then fed into machine learning models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or other advanced classifiers to predict the genres.  

This project serves as a practical application of NLP for text classification and provides hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in Python. It also allows exploration of various libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, and Scikit-learn to implement effective solutions.  

By completing this project, you gain a deeper understanding of the text classification pipeline and develop skills in processing unstructured data for actionable insights.
